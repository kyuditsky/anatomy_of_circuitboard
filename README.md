Slides from introductory class

While in residency at a local arts non-profit, I ran a class called Anatomy of a Circuit Board, which sought to teach the very basics of electronics & PCBs. It was to serve as an introduction to novices who were interested in electronics, synthesizers & hobbyists who wanted to have an idea of what they were looking at while troubleshooting gear on the fritz. It was not meant as an in-depth technical demonstration. Alongside the slideshow, I made available loose PCBs, keyboards and power supplies so as the students could inspect parts and ratings as we went along. Age range of attendees was between 20 & 65.
